we are using Tailwind CSS and applying styles inline via the className attribute, then we don't necessarily need a separate styles folder for CSS files. The index.css file with our Tailwind setup will handle all your styling needs.

However, if we ever find needing to write custom CSS or extend Tailwind with additional styles, we can still create a styles folder. If this folder is never used then delete it in production environment otherwise keep it.
